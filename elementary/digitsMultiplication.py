'''
You are given a positive integer. Your function should calculate the product of the digits excluding any zeroes.

For example: The number given is 123405. The result will be 1*2*3*4*5=120 (don't forget to exclude zeroes).

Input: A positive integer.
Output: The product of the digits as an integer.

How it is used: This task can teach you how to solve a problem with simple data type conversion.
Precondition: 0 < number < 106
